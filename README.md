# Describe-and-Infer Reinforcement Learning

A proposed algorithm for improving the efficiency and accuracy of RL agents in high stakes environments. 

## Some novel methods being explored in this context:
Hybrid agent design: A hybrid agent that combines the strengths of both descriptive and inferential approaches could be designed. This agent could first gather data and generate descriptive statistics, and then use these statistics to make informed decisions.

Transfer learning: The descriptive statistics generated by one agent could be used to improve the learning of another agent, potentially in a different environment. This transfer of knowledge could help the second agent make better decisions and reduce the number of trials and errors required.

Multi-modal inferencing: The descriptive statistics generated by the agent could be combined with other sources of information such as expert knowledge or prior knowledge of the environment to make more informed decisions. This could involve using multiple models and fusing the outputs in an ensemble approach to improve performance.

Active inference: The agent could actively seek out information that would improve its inferences and decision-making. This could involve strategically selecting actions that gather the most informative data and update the descriptive statistics.

Multi-agent collaboration: Multiple agents could collaborate and share information to improve their collective understanding of the environment and make better decisions. This could involve sharing descriptive statistics, inferences, and experiences to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the decision-making process.

These are just a few examples of novel methods that are being explored within the "describe-and-infer RL" framework. By combining descriptive and inferential approaches, it may be possible to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of RL in high stakes environments.
